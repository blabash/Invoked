# Overview

* Background and Overview
Invoked is a loose simulation of the playable character Invoker from a popular online game, Defense of the Ancients, or DOTA.
Players must defend themselves from an encroaching enemy by casting magical spells within the time limit.  The enemy will move
faster or require more spells to be vanquished as the player survives the onslaught.

Players enter in combinations of the Q, W and E keyboard keys and invoke spells based off these combinations with the R key.
